# AdvancedAbilities
A library that is provides a diverse ability system with triggers, effects, and conditions.

This project is currently being used in my [AdvancedEnchantments PM Remake](https://github.com/MrEcstsy/AdvancedEnchantments)

THIS IS STILL IN WORK.

# TODO
## Priority
- [x] Fully rework GenericTrigger to work with defense, and more triggers.
- [x] Find a way to easily use effects like "DECREASE_DAMAGE", "INCREASE_DAMAGE", "CANCEL_EVENT" & similar, in a simple and efficient way, since you can only modify damage in EntityDamageEvents, and cancel specific events like EntityDamageEvent (afaik)
- [ ] Add the remaining triggers once a solid foundation is built
- [ ] Better Error Handling (preferably similiar to the original. where it gets sent in the players chat. but tbh in whichever way itll grab the attention so they can fix the issue. like if they use a wrong value or misspell a key, etc.
- [ ] Addon to the above one, make sure it prevents crashes. like missing keys on an effect. etc
